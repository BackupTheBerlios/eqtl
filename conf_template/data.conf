# R/qtl prepares a model that depends on the genotype. The value to be matched
# in our setup is the expression level of the gene. In the file that is passed
# to R/qtl, which is the column where the expression level is expected for an
# individual? That column should be the same for all genes, i.e. files are
# created dynamically.
