INTROBACKGROUND	<p class=BLOCK> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Sclerosis">Multiple Sclerosis</a> (MS) is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_diseases">autoimmune</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease">neurodegenerative</a> disease. The characteristics of the disease and current options for treatment are nicely summarised on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Sclerosis">Wikipedia</a> page. Patients are generally considered to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics">genetic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predisposition">predisposition</a>, however, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study">twin-studies</a> predict a considerable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment">environmental</a> contribution to the disease that is still unknown. The molecular pathology</a> of the disease is not understood and yet no cure is available.</p><p class=BLOCK> For a better control of the contribution of environmental factors in their analysis and the possibility to perform directed breading in shorter generation times, Geneticists have looked-out for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model">animal models</a> of complex diseases. For MS, observations of MS-like symptoms in human patiens in recovery from viral infections led to the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis">experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a> (EAE). It was first applied to other primates and then to rodents as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism">model organisms</a>. EAE is accepted not as a complete model of MS but as a model of brain inflammation. All current treatments of MS were evaluated with this animal model.</p><p class=BLOCK> Some rat and mouse strains are known to differ in their susceptibility to EAE. A primary research goal is to identify those genes that contain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)">polymorphism</a> that sign responsible for the disease. The alleles of that gene must then be statistically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)">associated</a> with clinical parameters of the disease, the gene is therefore called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative Trait Gene">Quantitative Trait Gene</a> (QTG). If among the many differences between the strains those that contribute to the disease can be identified, this directly contributes to the understanding of the disease. For the transfer to the human organism, and hence the development of novel ailes for treatment, the gene identified in the model organism is of interest as a candidate gene but also all the genes that this gene interacts with.  </p> <p class=BLOCK> Experimentally, the statistical association first identifies a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus">Quantitative Trait Locus</a> (QTL) that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)">locus</a> expected to harbor about 100-200 genes. A genome-wide study will identify many QTL, each expected to contain at least one QTG. The identification of the QTG however is very difficult. If continuing with linkage analyses, the smaller a region is that was identified, the more laborious is the work imposed on the experimentalists. An educated guess of a gene in that locus that indicates genes that could be tested for polymorphisms in the human population is frequently used to circumvent further experimentation in the animal model.  </p> <p class=BLOCK> This work combines several approaches to further constrain the search for the QTG, partially by computationally performed investigations.  Hereto, the clinical scoring of each individual mice is further annotated with data from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray">microarray</a> experiment. Thus, a direct link to a molecular process is established as a trait of the disease, which promises stronger statistical power than the agglomeration of molecular effects in traits like the "severity of a disease".  Molecular processes are stronly interconnected. Nevertheless, individual genes can be expected to be stronger depending in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> expression on a gene that is close with respect to its molecular pathways than to a gene that appears not to be interacting. Secondly, we investigate pairs of loci that are particularly suited to predict a trait. We seek links in literature databases between genes of the two loci that are further connected to the expression trait. Thirdly, genome-wide expression data from Affymetrix gene chips taken from the parental strains indicate a differential expression of any gene involved, thus further increasing the confidence of the analysis.</p> 
INTROSYNOPSIS	This site guides through the result of an expression QTL analysis of the rat for the Experimental Autoimmune Excephalomyelitis (EAE).
#Text for Mouse QTL
#INTROMETHODS	<p class=BLOCK>Gene expression profiles were created for 119 mice with the the mouse sampler of the <a href="http://www.Illumina.com">Illumina</a> Bead Chips. Analyses were all performed with the package <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~kbroman/qtl/">R/qtl</a> of Karl Broman.  </p><p class=BLOCK>These web pages are prepared with <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, accessing a <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> database underneath. Links between loci were compared with information gathered by <a href="http://www.ihop-net.org/UniPub/iHOP/">iHOP</a>, comprising information both from pathway databases and the literature.  Data from the latter was verified manually.</p>
#Adapted to re-analysis with Rat
INTROMETHODS	<p class=BLOCK>Gene expression profiles were created for 150 rats with AffyMetrix GeneChips. QTL Analyses were all performed with the package <a href="http://www.rqtl.org">R/qtl</a> Version 1.09-43 of Karl Broman.</p><p class=BLOCK>These web pages are prepared with <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>. Analyses were controlled with Perl scripts on multiple Debian Linux clusters.</p>
